      <h2>Assorted Reviews</h2>
      <p>
        For the most part, I have found it can be particularly difficult to describe my feelings towards a book or other piece of media. The feelings are there to be sure, well-defined at that. I know <em>that</em> I enjoy or dislike a book as well as <em>why</em>. The issue lies with the "why-side" of my subconscience critic and its stuborn resistance to any effort to make a permanent mark on the world. Let's be real, I'm just not a good writer. I don't like to write&mdash;I get bored doing it. And writing about someone else's writing leads to amplified boredom and psychic pain. Even in the few instances I've enjoyed writing a review, I make a concerted effort to reassure myself that I actually hate writing and that any elation or joy I felt just then was for reasons other than the act itself. In any event, please enjoy the following exercises in which I wrestle against my better judgement to plaster an effort-riddled critique against my digital wall.

        <em>Project Hail Mary</em> - Andy Weir<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>
        Good God in heaven I hate this book. If anyone is actually reading these reviews, please heed this: if someone tells you they loved this book, run. Run fast. People who like this book are either dweeby tech bros who can't help but post on Reddit r/AskScience to regurgitate their high school level understanding of physics, or they are a person with zero self respect and are willing to have an excruciatingly simplistic story spoon-fed to them by the same god damn reddit user I just described. I disapprove of any enjoyer of this book. I've seen this described as hard sci-fi. It's not. It's a children's book masquerading as an adult's under a facade of repurposed <em>I F*cking Love Science</em> Facebook posts. This book is the literary equivalent of a straight to DVD Disney movie, both in it's pathetic excuse for characters or interesting story and because it clearly was written to be immediately ripped apart and repurposed as a movie screenplay. I don't know why I rated this a 2/5, it's a 1. <em>FUCK</em> this book and anyone who likes it.

        <em>Lying about Hitler: History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial</em> - Richard J. Evans<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This entry certainly requires explanation as the title alone may be a bit inflamatory. The 2016 election saw the beginnings of the rise of the alt-right: an ultra-nationalist, isolationist, racist wing of the conservative American mind as well as shockingly wide acceptance of consiracy theories like Qanon and (later) the stolen election as well as racist sentiments about immigrants and people of color. Interwoven through all this filth were other tenants of far-right thought including Holocaust revisionism. The "softening" or outright denial of the Holocaust was of course rooted in anti-semitism, but I noticed many conversations about such topics as "just asking questions",  "a pursuit of the truth", and "pushback against the establishment narrative" rather than blatant hatred. This type of framing seemed disturbingly accessible to audiences that normally wouldn't interact with other far-right ideas. Much of the American political spaces on the internet (dominated by young white men) seemed to hyperfixate on the value of "objejctivism", "logic" and "critical thinking." I put these in quotes because  I noticed that what was actually valued wasn't these concepts themselves but the <em>perception</em> of them. Therefore, these online groups in a way became victims of their own superficiality: anyone presenting information as "logical" or "objective" was considered authoritative, knowledgeable, virtuous&mdash;worth listening to. And if anyone within the space pushed back on any of the ideas proposed could be reasonably excised from the communication, perpetually increasing the toxicity and repugnance of the views necessary to be welcomed into the group-think. This was (and still is) an extremely effective way to build a rabid following who will relentlessly funnel money, fame, and power to thought-leaders. And unfortunately, it seemed that proponents of far-right concepts caught on to this fact earlier than anyone else.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was then shocked to learn that these exact same talking points, framed in the exact same detestable yet digestible to the "objective" viewer had been espoused more than a decade prior. <em>Lying About Hitler</em> chronicles the most famous of these past Holocaust revisionists: David Irving. Irving's tactics were nearly identical to the ones used today: frame the current understanding of the history of the Holocaust as incomplete and deceptive, and then introduce the "true facts" which are, in fact, <em>actually</em> incomplete and deceptive. Irving was extremely successful at this, he tapped into a latent beast in susceptible minds that fed on the misguided need to know something the whole world doesn't, to see the objective truth where the rest of humanity is blinded by emotion and dogma. Eerily similar to American conservatism today, especially after January 6th.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book also follows a detailed dive into the world of British lible laws. When Irving was accused of being a Holocaust denier, an antisemite, and knowingly deceptive, he sued Penguin Books and Deborah Lipstadt. In Britan, lible laws are shockingly skewed in favor of the prosecution rather than the defendant. This means that rather than the prosecution (Irving, in this case) needing to provide evidence that the defendant (the publication) is guilty of lible, the defendant needs to prove that they are <em>not</em> guilty. Therefore, the stage was set to establish into law the qualities that show, beyond a doubt, that someone was knowlingly lying about Hitler and the Holocaust. Richards Evans was hired as an expert witness for the defense of Penguin Books and spent two years studying Irving's works. The trial was ultimately won by the defending publication, they had shown that it was reasonable for them to accuse Irving of such detestible qualities. This book was incredible, it's one part detailed disection of how to build and present an exquisit legal case, one part exploration into the mind of one of the most famous Holocaust revisionists, and one part psychological analysis into how the populace can become so easily deceived. Everyone should read this, it should be required reading in every highscool, period.

        <em>City of Stairs</em> - Robert Jackson Bennet<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world created by Robert Jackson Bennett in City of Stairs is simply put: expansive, intricate, cohesive, and absolutely fascinating. How this story (and its two sequels) has not spawned a roaring cult fandom is beyond me. The mature source material is endlessly entertaining with still so much to explore; aided by Bennet’s masterful spinning of a world overflowing with complex social commentary, political upheaval, and divine magic that fits in so naturally. I could go on, there is so much to love in Bennet’s world: the waring, conquering, rebelling, and reconquering people of the Continent and Saypur, the ravaged, husked Continental capital Bulikov—the city of stairs, and the once very real and tangible Gods of limitless power, now murdered.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The characters inhabiting Bennet’s gritty, divine magic laden world are for the most part complex, driven, unique, and brimming with personality. Ashara (Shara) Komayd is a head-strong and ruthless detective who’s unwavering devotion to the discovery of truth and encyclopedic knowledge of the Divine fold together to form a near unstoppable brilliant force. Shara’s ability to simply outsmart enemies is balanced by her towering, door-filling hulk of a “secretary” Sigrud je Harkvaldsson. The stoic brawn to her brains, Sigrud will readily murder, eviscerate, or at the very least incapacitate anyone or anything in Shara’s way and in the next moment will provide a calm and reaffirming ear for Shara and her musings. Bennet builds his characters so carefully and consistently that I have to assume they are direct representations of real people in his life. Characters’ actions are so well justified by their personalities that I repeatedly noticed myself thinking “wow, that’s SO Sigrud”, or “that’s SO Shara”.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some side characters leave something to yearn for, but this is likely more a symptom of me being entirely sucked into this amazing world of the Divine Cities trilogy and wanting to know everything about everything down to every characters’ inner thoughts, the history of each city, the geography of the continent. Are there insects in this world? What kinds of animals roam the countryside? What are the oceans like? Are there other landmasses? Other people and other Gods yet to be discovered? Any fantasy detective novel that leaves the reader wondering about the resident flora and fauna a year after reading deserves some special commendations.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>City of Stairs</em> is brilliantly atmospheric (in part aided by fascinating excerpts of ancient texts, newspapers, and scientific journals presented at the beginning of each chapter), expertly written, with stunningly depictions of a fantastical world through the eyes of lovable and dynamic characters. I wish I could have my memory wiped just to relive the experience of exploring Bennett’s world with fresh eyes. But rereading City of Stairs several times will have to do for now.<br>

        <q>And Olvos said to them: 'Why have you done this, my children? Why is the sky wreathed with smoke? Why have you made war in far places, and shed blood in strange lands?'<br><br>

        And they said to Her: 'You blessed us as Your people, and we rejoiced, and were happy. But we found those who are not Your people, and they would not become Your people, and they were willful and ignorant of You. They would not open their ears to Your songs, or lay Your words upon their tongues. So we dashed them upon the rocks and threw down their houses and shed their blood and scattered them to the winds, and we were right to do so. For we are Your people. We carry Your blessing. We are Yours, and so we are right. Is this not what You said?'<br><br>

        And Olvos was silent</q><br>
