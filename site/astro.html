      <h2>Astrophysics</h2>
      <p>
	An astrophysicist uses mathematics and computation to make inferences and test hypotheses about how the universe works. An astrophysicist might study how stars move, how stars are borns, or how they die. They could study giant molecular clouds or black holes or galactic mergers. Even as an astrophysicist myself, I find that the majority of the field remains largely inaccesible because of how specialized each area of research is. My hope is to use this as a way to make my domain of astrophysics accessible to you, or at least interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
	I have two research focuses. First, I study how <a href="clusters.html">star clusters</a> form by designing and using computational models to simulate the movement of gas, the ignition of stars, and how they interact with each other and their environment. Second, I have designed a <a href="voramr.html">novel method</a> for translating simulation data from one simulation software suite to another. This second research focus has been extremely interesting to me computationally and intellectually and is certainly the more difficult project to explain. 
      </p>
      <p>
	My foray into the scientific depths of astrophysics has defined 6 years of my life, the majority of my 20s, and a lifetime's worth of staying up late thinking about the universe. Please proceed with relative caution, lest you be swept up by cosmic winds and taken by a swirl of stary intrigue.
