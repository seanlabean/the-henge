        <h1>Site-wide changes</h1>
        <h2>2022&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>November 3rd - <p>Added old blog posts ML-Basics and Coding Bootcamp to <a href="compsci.html">compsci</a>. This constitutes the complete conversion of my old website blogs into this new space.<q>Breakfast in Los Angeles, macrobiotic stuff.</q></p>
        <p>October 25th - Cleaned up <a href="compsci.html">compsci</a> and began <a href="diylisp.html">Sartoris</a>, a new passion project in which I build my own LISP. <q>I have found my God, meatless and senseless.</q></p>
        <p>October 11th - Removed substructure in <a href="future.html">future</a> and <a href="histroy.html">history</a>. <q>Roswell was actually a Russian psyop to sow turmoil in the American mind. I'm literally insane.</q></p>
        <p>October 4th - Added developed photos from NYC and Toronto <q>Let it rip.</q></p>
        <p>September 29th - Edited home page image and css site-wide for "out pointing" references.<q>Love is learned over time, 'til you're an expert in a dying field.</q></p>
        <p>August 26th - <a href="digital.html">Digital art</a> added as well as Ronin description.<q>23 minutes in Brussels, why can't they just leave us alone...</q></p>
        <p>August 12th - <a href="barchives.html">Book archives</a> is fully up to date and has established its final organizational style.<q>I am down millions.</q></p>
        <p>August 3rd - Big changes. Finalized website structure, stuck <a href="art.html">arts</a> in <a href="hobbies.html">hobbies</a> which makes the most sense to me. Added <a href="marchives.html">movie archives</a> and populated with a few recent watches. Removed "media" from <a href="journal.html">journal</a>. <q>Your feelings, the spattering it bores me, don't tell me.</q></p>
        <p>August 2nd - Added <a href="barchives.html">book archives</a> and began populating. Will reserve archives for yearly reviews and star ratings and <a href="breviews.html">book reviews</a> as effort posts. Added <a href="europe.html">europe pics</a> and <a href="media.html">photography journal</a> which needs to be refined. Why have it under <a href="journal.html">journal</a> and also have an unpopulated <a href="art.html">art page</a> under <a href="hobbies.html">hobbies</a>? <q>God is change.</q></p>
        <p>July 25th - Added <a href="void.html">the void</a>. In hobbies, <a href="books.html">books</a> page has taken form. <q>Whey oh whey oh, ay oh whey oh.</q></p> 
        <p>July 24th - Working on hobbies section today. Added <a href="art.html">arts</a>page, uploaded some pictures. Planning on the subsections being pictoral, physical, written. Or something similar. <q>I'm on a false ego trip, insecurity is rife.</q></p>
        <p>July 7th - Changed theme to my personal mind. <q>The mysteries of creation are there.</q></p>
