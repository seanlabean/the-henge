      <h2>What are hobbies to me</h2>
      <p>
        At times I see myself as sinfully simple. I've engage in a seemingly relentless struggle to "find a hobby", to find something that interests me or a thing that <em>should</em> interest me. I've resorted to Youtube videos "how to find a hobby", "10 cheap, fun hobbies". The consistent problem I've recognized within myself is a reluctance to persevere when the hobby in question becomes tedious, or difficult, or not what I envisioned. 
      </p>
      <p>  
        For a while, I was under the impression that there was something faulty with my approach to hobbies, or something wrong with how my mind worked. Was my attention span fucked from being on the internet too much? Has my ability to persevere always been lacking? Am I an insufficient person, am I simply someone with no sustained interests at all? A dark line of questioning indeed, enough to stifle anyone's curiosity to try something new. The last question though briefly piqued my interest, maybe I was just someone who had many interests, ones that lasted only a month or two at a time. And I still believe there is some virtue to accepting this as a personality quirk of mine, though I'll touch on this elsewhere. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As I continued my melancholic search for my "one true hobby", the thing I could engage in tirelessly and become a master at, I came to realize I may already have one (more than one, really).

      <h3>Books</h3>
      <p>
        I really like <a href="books.html">reading</a>. This was a relatively new discovery of mine, but it does in fact turn out that I cannot get enough of reading. I love starting a new book, I love finishing a book, keeping track of how many I've read, reviewing them, thinking about which to read next.
