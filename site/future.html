      <h2>From October 2022</h2>
      <h3>The Living Machine; Living Computation</h3>
      <p>
        <a href='compsci.html'>Computers</a> in the silicon age are designed with the presumption of permanence. That for every input, there is an output. And ideally, when given the same input again, no matter how much time has passed the same output will be produced. The other bases of modern computation are those of rigid binary logic and uncompromising memory management. This inherently creates two fundamental flaws. First, systems such as this are unable to be scaled indefinitely (gotta look into this more). Second, the system is riddled with failure points. If memory becomes corrupted during a process, there goes your “permanence”, good luck getting the same output if your RAM cannot access necessary memory. Counterintuitively, a computer’s requirement for precise reliability results in it inevitable unpredictable failure. </p>
      <p>
        What if computers were designed to mimic biology? (In the true sense, not the <em>let’s make a neural net with as many nodes as we can and train a machine to recognize patterns</em>). What if computational elements of a machine were interchangeable, if the system was scalable and able to work around sudden local failures at the expense of perfect precision. Imagine a world where computational elements were but grains of sand that one could purchase by the ounce and simply pour into their vessel to increase computational ability or to replace lost ability from damage. The simple contact of the grains to one another facilitating the message passing. Imagine redundant safety faculties which allow the system to operate in acceptable ways while negating the effects of degradation or destruction. In the human body, the liver does not care if a toe is lopped off. The brain does not stop operating if an arm is broken. Even the brain within itself can withstand some level of trauma and destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically, the dynamics of computation have been perceived as a binary battle between Control and Chaos. Control being the way of traditional computing in which authoritarian orders are issued by a central body; every element of a system has a job and <em>must</em> complete said job in exactly the way intended but only when explicitly asked to, if the element fails to follow this doctrine, the system fails. For small tasks, an authoritarian deterministic system is inarguably ideal, but perfect top-down Control cannot be effectively scaled, the larger the system, the greater the points of failure. Chaos, on the other hand, can be scaled infinitely. Though of course the absence of perfect deterministic Control leads to complete anarchy, turbulence, inherent unpredictablility, and lack of any real-world utility. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But what if there is a median, a balance between the forces of Chaos and Control: Resilience, where a system is governed from the bottom-up where individual elements can act on their own with or without direction from others, a system that is resilient to abrupt change. Such a system will be at the mercy of some level of Chaos, inherently lacking the rigid, perfect, and deterministic characteristics of it traditional Control counterparts but at the benefit of being scalable, resilient.

      <h2>From July 2022</h2>
      <h3>The Career</h3>
      <p>
        My future is inarguably bright. A year from now, I will have a doctorate degree in physics with a focus in computational astrophysics. I will be Dr. Sean Lewis. I will have marketable skills in <a href='compsci.html'>high performace and distributive computing</a>, peer reviewed published research, and the stamp of approval that I can design long-term goals and commit to them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, my bright future is entirely obscured by my inability to imagine myself succeeding in environments other than academics and my petrifying confusion as to what my <a href="purpose.html">purpose</a> in this world is meant to be.
      </p>
      <h3>The Land</h3>
      <p>
        Owning land. Knowing I own the earth beneath my feet, not just the building I sit in. Working that earthen land.
