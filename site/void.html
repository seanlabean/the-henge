      <h2>The Void</h2>
      <p>
        The Void operates as a dumping ground for my impermanent interest. Though fleeting, these motes of datum are nevertheless worthwhile to record, for posterity's sake if nothing else and for a cathartic practice of organizing my thoughts at most. Enjoy the Void, explore its halls and take what you will.

      <p>
        This should probably be noted more prominently: Devine is the reason this online repository of mine exists and the reason why I am inspired to do as much as I can with my conscious experience. Devine one of two members in the art group <a href="100r.co" target="_out">100 Rabbits</a> which creates tools, art, and philosophies all from their skipper boat Pino. The extent to their success is, even under normal circumstances, fascinating. Their uniqueness as artists manifests in the feedback loop between their self-imposed lifestyle restrictions and their creations. How do you maximize computer battery efficiency when you need to edit photos but your ownly power source is a small solar panel? You code your own photoshop. Creating music? Make your own esoteric coding language. Indeed, my <a href="./thoughts.html">thinking</a> is that from immense pressure comes the brightest diamonds.

      <h3>Dave Ackley & Living Computation</h3>

      <p>
        Dave Ackley is professor emeritus at the University of New Mexico. His pursuit of passion is the creation of an indefinitely scalable computational architecture. The computer as we know it today relies on deterministic computation, a CPU and RAM. While such an architectural structure allows for precise processing, it is inherently limiting and hinders computational growth. The <a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu/~ackley/papers/hotos-11.pdf" target="_out">infinite machine</a> would prioritize resilience, survivability, and graceful degredatiion not only for the hardware, but up throught the entire computational stack. Low level communications would rely on relative and spatially dependent addressing rather than immutable global addresses like a common computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Professor Ackley's concepts of the infinitely scalable computer challenge the fundamental principles of computation. The departure from determinism and rigid logic is difficult to accept, let alone pursue. To a certain extent, the infinite machine bleeds into the realm of biology and biological systems. This inspired a couple <a href="future.html">short thoughts</a> that I fleshed out recently.

      <h3>Laurie Anderson</h3>

      <p>
        <a href="https://laurieanderson.com/about/">Laurie Anderson</a> tells stories. I visited Laurie Anderson's gallery at the <a href="https://hirshhorn.si.edu/" target="_out">Hirshhorn</a> modern art museum in February 2022; her work and personality are singularly fascinating to me. Her work is so vast and all-encompassing: music, <a href="paper.html">painting</a>, sculpting, <a href="compsci.html">coding</a>, poetry, <a href="photography.html">photography</a>, and gonzo journalism. She is the type of person whos relentless pursuit of her own interests seem less than effortless, her creative abilities seem to require no effort whatsoever. In fact, I am convinced that is very literally the case. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It's people like Laurie Anderson that are gifted with an obsession that turns their mind open to the outside world, a talent so beautiful and brilliant that any onlooker is simultaneously inspired, inadequate, envious, and greatful. Though despite her intellectual prowess and her (seemingly) innate creative abilities, Laurie seems incredibly kind and self-aware of her gift. I am happy she is not humble. She inspires me to own my successes, to not shy away from applying myself to the fullest extent of my talent. I want to be like her.

        Laurie's breakout moment was the song and accompanying music video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vkfpi2H8tOE&ab_channel=NonesuchRecords" target="_out">O Superman</a>.

      <h3>Sludgefest</h3>
      <p>
        Alvin, Simon, and Theodore scaled to 16 bpm, unleashing unexpected (and unwanted) grunge and grit. A disturbing and fascinating manipulation of music.
