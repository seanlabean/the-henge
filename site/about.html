      <h2>The Henge, The Repository, The Changing of the Leaves</h2>
      <p>
          I originally began this website as a means to make a more permanent mark on the world. I was finding that my fleeting interests and even more substantial hobbies came and went with nothing to show other than slowly fading memories. I figured that writing things down in combination with learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript would be a fun endeavor: no expectations, no deadlines, just record keepings and developing new skills. 
      </p>
      <p>
        And so, this loosely bundled assortment of files exists as a dynamic document where I can track my <a href='journal.html'>life</a>, <a href='research.html'>scientific and computational</a> interests, and what I <a href='hobbies.html'>do for fun</a>. Yearly reflections will serve as an evaluation of my status as a experiential force in the universe.
