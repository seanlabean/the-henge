      <h2>Encryption</h2>
      <p>
        This project means to teach me how encryption is designed, deployed, and defeated. I will use this space to detail several iterations of encryption/decryption methods.
      </p>

      <h3>ascii-shift.c</h3>
      <p>
        ASCII-shift is a very simple method of encryption in which all ASCII values of a text characters in a to-be encrypted file are shifted by some user-defined integer. The result, even with a small shift, is relatively unintelligable. I consider this a basic level of encryption akin to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar Cipher</a>. Decryption should be relatively simple and can be brute forced by either searching a range of integer shifts or testing for character-doublets (e.g. ee, oo, ll) or the isolated characters i/I and a/A. This program allows for user control of the integer shift and handles simple type and missing file errors.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course ASCII-shifting regular text will change a regonizable phrase into a much more foreign display of characters, rather than the alphebetical tape acting like a loop, forever resulting in intelligable English lettering.
      </p>
      <p>As an example, this is the ASCII-shift left by 42:
      <code>Hello World! This is a sample text file to test encryption algorithms.</code>
      <code>;BBEö-EHB:÷ö*>?Iö?Iö7öI7CFB;öJ;NJö&lt;?B;öJEöJ;IJö;D9HOFJ?EDö7B=EH?J>CIà</code>
      </p>
      <p>While the text may be intimidating, the character doublett and isolated characters exploit is still relatively easy to discover: <code>ll &rarr; BB</code> and <code>a &rarr; ö7ö</code> (recall that [space] has an ASCII code that is also shifted, so the isolated <code>a</code> is surrounded by two identical characters). This type of encryption functions well to hide your file contents from your kid sister or computationally inept parents, but it beyond trivial when compared to the levels of used by nation states. In fact, many would argue that an ASCII-shift counts not as encryption but as simple obscuration. Given enough time, such an encrypted message can be deciphered with no additional information (in this case a basic computer program might need only a second or two). True encryption methods available today are legitimately impossible to decipher without first stealing additional data from the parties sending/receiving the message.</p>
      <p>To prove a point, I will be coding an up an simple decoder for short cryptograms such as my example published in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/182987.184078" target="_out">1994 by George W. Hart.</a></p>
