      <h2>Reflections of 2021 & An early flurry in 2022</h2>
      <p>
        Pure inspiration! 2021 ended with my feeling exceptionally pleasant in regards to my ability as a reader and the sheer enjoyment I received from not only the completion of books (and the bragging rights that comes with it) but from the act of reading itself. At the star of 2022, reading truly become part of my routine and moreso part of who I was. I had a fantastic start to the year, flying through a dozen books in 5 months.
      </p>
      <p>
        Things changed midway through the year with my taking on a particularly straining challenge of reading Brandon Sanderson’s Way of Kings. I had confidence I’d enjoy the book, but the length does not lend well to someone who has a books-per-year requirement hanging over them. Combined with a semi-spontaneous trip to Europe, reading progress slid to a halt for nearly a month. Luckily, I was able to snap out of the funk with relative ease.
      </p>
      <p>
        It did expose a potentially catastrophic defect in my personality of “Reader”, that being I find it incredibly easy to engage in hyper focused reading throughout my train trips to work but am wholly unable to find an urge to read if I don’t ride that train. My habit building has made me dependent on train travel to read. Of course this is fine now, but how will this affect me later when my commute changes or becomes non-existent? Do I have the capacity to read for more than 25 minutes at a time?

      <h2>2020 Reflections and a slow start in 2021</h2>
      <p>
        By the end of 2020, I was fairly confident in my interest in sci-fi/fantasy books. This wasn’t entirely a surprise to me, my tastes generally follow a stereotypical trend of a nerdy science guy. But refinement is still possible on this front: why do I like some sci-fi stories but not others? What makes me excited to read one book but bored and tired in another? In addition to developing my knowledge of my favorite genre, I also noticed that I enjoyed nonfiction books that focused on current social issues. I also discovered Audible and wanted to ultilize the auditory version of storytelling especially when trying to absorb more intense topics or books that are just prohibitively long.
      </p>
      <p>
        This year did not start off perfectly. As I had predicted, the 2 week break in reading I took over the holidays resulted in me starting two books in the first week of January which I promptly stopped after a few days I did not read or think about reading for months. At this point I felt the same about reading as I did other stressful aspects of my life such as my research: I didn’t want to do it. At all. And entirely avoiding reading got easier and easier as the days, weeks, and months went on. Once I recognize I have failed a participatory task (like reading consistently) it’s so easy to continue failing, this is true for other aspects in my life as well. The hardest part about breaking the cycle is engaging or re-engaging with the productive action. It wasn’t until June of 2021 that I was able to start reading again. By that time, I had lost half a year to my procrastination and I no longer knew if it was possible to hit my goal of 14 books read in the year. We’ll see that I do manage to reach and exceed this goal and that a few books in I actually stumble across a self-help book that helped me gain the vocabulary to describe my procrastination.

      <h2>Quick-look 2020</h2>
      <p>
        Ok, a few months late on this one. In truth, a few years too late. In January of 2020, I resolved to start reading for pleasure. Leading up to this decision, I had convinced myself that I never truly enjoyed reading, and that any endulgance in any book of any kind was simply a byproduct of “my requirements” as a student or as the son of a bookworm of a mom. Certainly by my late twenties, the majority of my reading was confined to an academic setting (and therefore was horribly riddled with a SparkNotes-level interaction with the material). I wasn’t especially bothered by this, it was just who I was: not a reader. But I could not shake the nagging uneasiness I felt whenever someone asked me: what is your favorite kind of book? My lack of answer to this question bothered me deeply, particularly because its broad scope felt like I should have an answer, infinitely more than what my favorite individual book. Everyone would have trouble picking one book as their favorite. But did I really have no idea as to the types of literature I enjoyed? Do I like nonfiction more than fiction? Fantasy more than novels? I couldn’t say.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, at the turn of the decade, I decided to find out. This excercise began simply: I expected to read one book a month for a year. At 10 - 20 pages a day, I felt this was more than reasonable, but I would need to meet that daily goal every single day or my efforts would immediately implode. I knew this to be true, it was a common villian I’ve fought against in the past, my hobbies stopping sharply when I let my guard down for the first time. In this blog, I chronicle my journey through my books. I will give a star rating as well as either a summary, how I felt while reading, why I chose the book, or anything else of note that comes to mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        If anything, I hope this blog inspires someone to pick up a book and I hope it provides some proof that “becoming a reader” can really happen to anyone and at any time. You are who you say you are, and if you want to lose yourself in a written story - start now!
